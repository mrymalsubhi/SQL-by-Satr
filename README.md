# SQL by Satr


This repository contains the projects I completed during the SQL course by Satr. The course covered various aspects of SQL and provided hands-on experience in creating and managing databases. Below is a brief overview of each course & project:

### SQL101: School Database [(Course Link)](https://satr.codes/courses/FtkmhtJpQW/view)
- In this course, the focus is on the basics of SQL in dealing with databases and  **managing** their contents, including storing and displaying data.

- SQL101 projetc: In this project, I created a central database for a high school. The database includes tables for students, teachers, and subjects, with specific information stored for each.

### SQL102: Data Manipulation [(Course Link)](https://satr.codes/courses/APjgdQqVWR/view)
- In this course, the focus is on how to deal with data in tables and perform operations on them using different functions such as **Aggregate functions** & **Scalar functions**.
  
- SQL102 projetc: The project served as a complement to the Level 1 SQL project. The requirements for this project included creating tables for outstanding students and students who did not pass based on their cumulative averages. I also performed various **data filtering and analysis** tasks, such as **applying AVG, MAX, and MIN functions** to calculate GPA statistics, and identifying outstanding students with a perfect cumulative average.


### SQL103: Advanced SQL Concepts [(Course Link)](https://satr.codes/courses/4af40f48-e5c5-44a8-87c7-3362d89cb574/view)
- This course focuses on advanced concepts in SQL such as the concept of **relationships between tables**, **JOINS concept**, **FOREIGN KEY concept**.
  
- SQL103 projetc: The project served as a complement to the Level 1 & 2 SQL project. In this project, advanced SQL concepts were applied to improve the database structure and functionality. This included establishing relationships between tables, **creating a Procedure** to display shared data, **implementing a view** for easy access to teacher information, **creating an index** for efficient searching, and managing the deletion of views and indexes as needed. These enhancements enhanced the overall organization and performance of the database.
